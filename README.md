# MIDI Bass Pedal
 This is my first project with an Arduino Uno board and in total it took me three months (some breaks) until its completion.  This prototype has been tested for 4 months with satisfactory results.        I live in a country where there are no stores for electronic components or mechanical parts.  Except for the Arduino board, throughout the project, parts of discontinued equipment were used.  The project was divided into three main parts:  1- Design and assembly of the electronic board.  2- Creation and commissioning of the control software.  3- Assembly of the entire mechanical system.  In the final stage, the parts were joined and the entire system was calibrated.  Consult the MIDI Bass Pedal Documentation.pdf document for more detailed information.
